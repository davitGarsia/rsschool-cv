#### Briefly About Myself

Nevertheless of my deep interest in programming and technology in general, I started studying international law at university, the decision mostly made because of public prejudice that you have to be some kind of math genius to study computer science.
But I was not happy in the chosen field, it was excruciatingly monotonous, so I decided to change fields.
I came across a community of programmers - BitCamp which helped me get acquainted with the basics of programming and helped me find resources.
After a period of learning very basics of programming, I started studying HMML, CSS and JavaScript. I was amazed with this field and became more and more interested. Programming was a kind of discipline that I could not be bored with as it required all my attention. I loved puzzles, intellectual games from and discovered that this was the line of work I liked most.
I studied HTML, CSS and JavaScript with several resources: The Odin Project, Udemy courses, Youtube tutorials. Currently I am studying Angular framework and brushing up on my skills with the help of Rs School. I am interested in becoming a full-stack developer, so I want to learn a backend language after angular. At this stage I am interested in Node.js.
I also regularly practice solving problems on websites like codewars, hackerrank and leetcode.
I hope to become a proficient developer in the coming months and work on interesting projects.

        siblings.forEach(el => {
